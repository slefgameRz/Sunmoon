## 🎯 Next Steps for User

### To Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel
# or
vercel --prod
```

### To Test Locally
```bash
pnpm dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Test: GET /api/forecast/compact?lat=6.8495&lon=101.9674&debug=true
```

### To Update Mobile App
- Use new compact endpoint: `/api/forecast/compact`
- Import client: `import { compactClient } from '@/lib/compression/compact-client'`
- See QUICK_START.md for integration examples

### To Monitor Performance
- Check response headers: `X-Compression-Ratio`, `X-Original-Size`
- Track binary sizes vs original
- Monitor user feedback
