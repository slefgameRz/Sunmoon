## 📝 Key Concepts (Quick Reference)

### What is "Offline-First"?
- App works **fully** offline after first tile download
- No internet needed for predictions (only for tile updates)
- Service Worker + IndexedDB handle caching

### What is "Harmonic Prediction"?
- Decompose tide into 37+ periodic waves (constituents)
- Each constituent has: frequency (known), amplitude (from data), phase (from data)
- Sum them up: $\eta(t) = \sum H_i \cos(\omega_i t + \phi_i + corrections)$

### What is "Nodal Correction"?
- Lunar node precesses every 18.6 years → affects tide amplitude
- Applied as multiplier factor: $f_i(t)$
- Makes predictions accurate across years

### What is a "Tile"?
- Geographic patch (e.g., 1°×1° around Bangkok)
- Contains: 37+ harmonic constituents for that location
- Compressed: ≤500 KB
- Downloaded once, cached offline

### What is "Delta Update"?
- Instead of re-downloading full tile when data updates
- Download only the **changes** (patch file, e.g., 45 KB vs 300 KB)
- Apply patch to old version → get new version
- Saves bandwidth ~85%

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Leadership Decision** (Tech Lead + PM)
   - [ ] Approve specification → proceed to Phase 1
   - [ ] Decide WASM language (Rust recommended)
   - [ ] Allocate Phase 1 team (1 WASM eng, 1 frontend, 1 data eng, 1 QA)

2. **Pre-Phase 1 Prep**
   - [ ] Task 1.1: WASM language POC (by Friday)
   - [ ] Task 1.2: Contact FES2022/TPXO providers (by Monday)
   - [ ] Task 1.3: Set up baseline accuracy testing (by Wednesday)

3. **Team Kickoff** (End of Week)
   - [ ] Review **PHASE_1_QUICKSTART.md** together
   - [ ] Assign week-by-week stories
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD for WASM builds
   - [ ] Create GitHub project board with Phase 1 tasks

## 📞 Questions & Clarifications

**Q: Why 20 weeks? Can we go faster?**  
A: Timeline includes rigorous field testing (weeks 13–16) with 3 coastal sites over 60 days each. Accuracy validation is non-negotiable for production.

**Q: What if we skip offline support?**  
A: Defeats primary goal. Many coastal users have poor connectivity; offline-first is competitive advantage.

**Q: Can we use existing libraries instead of custom WASM?**  
A: Possibly (UTide.js, T-Tide ports), but custom WASM gives control over optimization + allows integration with our tile system.

**Q: What's the minimum viable product (MVP)?**  
A: Phase 1 + Phase 2 (≈6 weeks): Offline-capable app with basic harmonic predictions. Then Phase 3–5 for calibration + accuracy.
